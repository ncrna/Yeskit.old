SCKIT is an R package designed for single-cell gene expression data importation, integration, clustering, differential analysis, functional analysis, and visualization. Since SCKIT does not change the default data structure of Seurat, it can be easily integrated into most existing scRNA-seq workflows. 

SCKIT can be used to read other information (such as gene mutation-by-cell matrix, pathogen count-by-cell matrix) and store them as additional data in the Seurat obj@metadata slot. In addition, SCKIT also has the function of reading and distinguishing the source of cells from the scRNA-seq data of xenografts samples.
