SCKIT is an R package designed for single-cell gene expression data importation, integration, clustering, differential analysis, functional analysis, and visualization. Since SCKIT does not change the data structure of Seurat object, it can be easily integrated into most existing scRNA-seq workflows. SCKIT can be used to read other information (such as gene mutation-by-cell matrix, pathogen count-by-cell matrix) and store them as additional data in the Seurat metadata slot. Besides, SCKIT has the function of reading and distinguishing the cell sources from xenografts samples' scRNA-seq data.
